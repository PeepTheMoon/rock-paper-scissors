Rock Paper Scissors
Build a R-P-S Game, user vs computer. Track win/lose/draw record.

Steps
Make a New Repo
Make the repo on github first, then clone it locally and work from there. Call it rock-paper-scissors.

Make a New Page
New index.html page for the game
New app.js and main.css files used by new page
Design the App
Using HTML and CSS, design the look and feel of the rock, paper, scissors game. At a minimum you will need:

Page layout (title, header, footer?, etc.)
Explain the rules (paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats papers), an HTML List might be a good semantic choice.
Radio buttons with same name for grouping for choosing rock, paper, or scissors (images anyone?)
Button for "Play"
Display of wins and losses and draws
Display of result of each game (can be text and/or images), should indicate what the computer threw and what the result was (win, loss, draw)
Computer Throw
Create a getRandomThrow function in a module which should be called get-random-throw.js

This function needs to generate a random numbers and triage that into returning rock, paper, or scissors accordingly.

TDD checkResult Function
Given a user choice, and a random throw for the computer, we will need to know the game result (from the user's perspective): "win", "lose", or "draw"

TDD a checkResult function that:

Has two parameters: player and computer
Returns one of the following values:
draw - the throws are identical
win - the player's throw beats the computer throw
lose - the computer's throw beats the player's throw
Write one test at a time, each test can address one of the nine possible outcomes.

You can assume valid input, meaning the passed input will always be a valid throw of rock, paper, or scissors.

App
The r-p-s.js file is imported via a <script> tag in r-p-s.html.

Sections
Imports:
Your getRandomThrow and checkResults functions
Reference needed DOM elements:
The radio buttons with the user's throw choice
You can alternatively use document.querySelector('input:checked') in your event handler to get the actively checked radio button each time the play button is clicked
The button the user will click for playing
The element(s) needed to display:
throw result (win, lose, or draw)
current wins, losses, and draws counts
Setup Application State (what will change over time)
wins
losses
draws
Add event listener(s):
Subscribe to the button's click event using addEventListener
App
Take some time to plan out your logic flow of what should happen once the user makes a choice and clicks the button to play a game.

What are the steps of the process that will need to occur?

Use techniques like drawing a flow diagram, and/or pseudo-coding
